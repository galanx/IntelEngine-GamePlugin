name: CancelCurrentTask
description: >
  Stop your current active task entirely.

  Use when:
  - Someone tells you to stop, wait, hold on, come back, or stay
  - You decide the task is no longer worth doing
  - You need to follow someone (cancel task first, then follow)

  You don't need this before starting a new task — new tasks replace the current one automatically.

  Does NOT cancel scheduled tasks — those still trigger at their scheduled time.
  To adjust speed without stopping, use ChangeSpeed instead.
