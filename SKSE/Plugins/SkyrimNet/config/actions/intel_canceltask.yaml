name: CancelCurrentTask
description: >
  Stop and cancel your current active task. Use this BEFORE starting a different task.

  Use when:
  - Someone tells you to stop, wait, hold on, come back, or stay
  - Someone asks you to do something else (cancel current task first)
  - You decide the task is no longer worth doing
  - You are told to follow someone (cancel task first, then follow)
  - Any instruction that contradicts your current task

  You MUST use this action before starting a new task or following someone.
  If your Task Status shows an active task and you need to stop, use this.

  NOTE: This only cancels active tasks (traveling, fetching, delivering, searching).
  It does NOT cancel scheduled tasks — those will still trigger at their scheduled time.
  To adjust speed on an active travel task without canceling, use ChangeSpeed instead.
