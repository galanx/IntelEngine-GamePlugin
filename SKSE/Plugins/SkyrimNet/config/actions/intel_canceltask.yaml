name: CancelCurrentTask
description: >
  Stop your current active task. Check your "Current Task" section.

  Use when:
  - Someone tells you to stop, wait, hold on, come back, or stay
  - You decide the task is no longer worth doing
  - You are told to follow someone (cancel task first, then follow)

  Only use if your "Current Task" shows an active task and you want to STOP entirely.
  Starting a new task (GoToLocation, FetchPerson, etc.) replaces the current one
  automatically — you don't need to cancel first.

  Does NOT cancel scheduled tasks — those still trigger at their scheduled time.
  To adjust speed without stopping, use ChangeSpeed instead.
