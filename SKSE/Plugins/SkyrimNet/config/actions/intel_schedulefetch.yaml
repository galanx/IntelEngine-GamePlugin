name: ScheduleFetch
description: >
  Schedule physically fetching someone LATER. Delayed FetchPerson — you stay put now, go escort them back later.

  Use when:
  - "go get Ysolda after sunset" → no message, just bring them back later
  - You need someone's physical presence at a future time and will personally escort them

  Check your "Scheduled Commitment" first — if you already have a task scheduled,
  don't schedule another unless the details changed.

  NOT ScheduleDelivery. If there are WORDS to relay ("tell X that...", "let X know..."),
  use ScheduleDelivery. ScheduleFetch = no message, just physically go get them later.

  You will NOT leave immediately. You go when the time comes.

  The target must be a person who actually exists.
