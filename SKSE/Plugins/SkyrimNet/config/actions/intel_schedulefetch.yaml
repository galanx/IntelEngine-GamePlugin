name: ScheduleFetch
description: >
  Schedule fetching a person at a FUTURE TIME. Delayed version of FetchPerson — you stay put now and go later.

  Use when:
  - You decide to go get someone later: "I'll go find Ysolda after sunset"
  - Someone (player or NPC) asks you to fetch a person later, not right now
  - You want to bring someone to a location at a future time
  - You overhear that someone is needed and decide to go get them later
  - Another NPC asks you to bring someone to them at a specific time

  This schedules the task for later. You will NOT leave immediately.
  When the time comes, you will automatically go fetch the person.

  IMPORTANT: The target must be a person who actually exists.
  The system uses fuzzy matching, so minor typos are okay.
