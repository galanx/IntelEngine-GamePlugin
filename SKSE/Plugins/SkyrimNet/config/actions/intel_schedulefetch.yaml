name: ScheduleFetch
description: >
  Schedule fetching someone LATER. Delayed FetchPerson — stay put now, go get them when the time comes.

  TRIGGER: Need to bring someone back, but NOT right now.

  Examples:
  - "go get Ysolda after sunset"
  - You need someone's presence at a future time

  DECISION RULES:
  - Fetch NOW = FetchPerson
  - Fetch LATER = ScheduleFetch
  - Deliver WORDS later = ScheduleDelivery (has a message to relay)
  - Go to a PLACE later = ScheduleMeeting (no person to fetch)

  You will NOT leave immediately. You go when the time comes.
