name: DeliverMessage
description: >
  Go TELL someone something. You carry WORDS, not people.

  Use when you have something to SAY to someone:
  - "tell Alvor to come to the Inn in 2 hours" → you go say that to Alvor
  - "let Jarl Balgruuf know about the dragon"
  - "warn Adrianne that trouble is coming"
  - "go tell X to meet me at Y" → message with meeting request

  Check your "Current Task" first — if you have an active task, use CancelCurrentTask before this.

  NOT FetchPerson. FetchPerson = physically escort someone back. This = relay words.
  If someone says "tell X to come here" that is a MESSAGE, not a fetch.

  If the message asks the target to meet somewhere, set meetLocation and meetTime.
