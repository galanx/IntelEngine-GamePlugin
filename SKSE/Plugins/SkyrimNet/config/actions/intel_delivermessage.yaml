name: DeliverMessage
description: >
  Travel to find someone and deliver a specific MESSAGE to them. You are a messenger.

  Use when:
  - Someone asks you to relay a message to another person: "tell X that...", "let X know...", "warn X about..."
  - You decide on your own to warn, inform, or notify someone about something
  - You have important news that someone else needs to hear
  - You want to pass along what you were told to the right person

  If the message includes a request to MEET somewhere at a specific time,
  set meetLocation and meetTime so the recipient will travel there after hearing your message.

  IMPORTANT:
  - The target must be a person who actually exists
  - You must have a clear message to deliver
