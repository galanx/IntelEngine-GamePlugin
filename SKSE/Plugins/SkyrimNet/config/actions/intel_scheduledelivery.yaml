name: ScheduleDelivery
description: >
  Schedule telling someone something LATER. Delayed DeliverMessage — stay put now, deliver words when the time comes.

  TRIGGER: Need to relay a message to someone, but NOT right now.

  Examples:
  - "tell Adrianne after sunset that I need a sword"
  - "send word to Jarl Balgruuf tomorrow morning"
  - "let Nazeem know later that I was looking for him"

  DECISION RULES:
  - Deliver words NOW = DeliverMessage
  - Deliver words LATER = ScheduleDelivery
  - Fetch a PERSON later (no message) = ScheduleFetch
  - Go to a PLACE later = ScheduleMeeting

  You will NOT leave immediately. You go when the time comes.
