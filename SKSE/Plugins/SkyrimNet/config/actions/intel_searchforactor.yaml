name: SearchForActor
description: >
  Lead someone TO a person. You guide, they follow — you travel TOGETHER.

  Use when:
  - "take me to Alvor", "show me where Ysolda is", "help me find Nazeem"
  - The requester wants to COME WITH YOU to find someone
  - You and another NPC search for someone together

  NOT FetchPerson (solo round trip, requester stays behind).
  NOT DeliverMessage (carrying words, not guiding someone).

  The target must be a person who actually exists.
