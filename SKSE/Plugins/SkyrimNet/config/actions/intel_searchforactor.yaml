name: SearchForActor
description: >
  Lead the way to find someone TOGETHER with the requester. You guide, they follow. Group search.

  Use when:
  - Someone asks you to help find someone: "help me find X", "where is X?"
  - Someone says "take me to X", "show me where X is", "lead me to X"
  - You offer to help search for someone who is lost or missing
  - You and another NPC go looking for someone together
  - You decide to help locate someone on your own initiative

  You will travel toward the target. If the requester is following you,
  you wait for them if they fall behind so you arrive together.

  IMPORTANT: The target must be an actor who actually exists.
  The system uses fuzzy matching, so minor typos are okay.
