name: SearchForActor
description: >
  Lead someone TO a person. You guide, they follow — you travel TOGETHER.

  TRIGGER: Someone wants to COME WITH YOU to find a person.

  Examples:
  - "take me to Alvor", "show me where Ysolda is", "help me find Nazeem"
  - "lead me to the blacksmith", "where is she? Take me there"

  DECISION RULES:
  - Requester COMES WITH YOU = SearchForActor (travel together)
  - Requester STAYS BEHIND, you go alone = FetchPerson (solo round trip)
  - You carry words, not guide someone = DeliverMessage
