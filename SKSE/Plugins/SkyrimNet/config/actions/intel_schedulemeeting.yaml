name: ScheduleMeeting
description: >
  AGREE TO MEET LATER or PLAN TO GO SOMEWHERE LATER. You stay put now, travel when the time comes.

  TRIGGER: Any mention of a future time + a place (explicit or implied).
  This includes farewells, agreements, promises, and self-initiated plans.

  Examples that MUST trigger this action:
  - "see you in the evening" / "see you tonight" / "see you tomorrow"
  - "meet me at the inn at sunset" / "let's meet at noon"
  - "sure, tomorrow evening" / "alright, I'll be there" / "tomorrow then"
  - "until tonight" / "I'll come by later" / "catch you at dusk"
  - You want to visit someone or go somewhere later on your own

  If no place is named, use the current location or the most relevant place from context.

  KEY RULE: If the conversation implies "I will be somewhere at a future time" = ScheduleMeeting.
  Does NOT matter if it's casual ("see you later") or formal ("meet me at Dragonsreach at noon").

  NOT GoToLocation — GoToLocation means leave RIGHT NOW.
  NOT ScheduleFetch/ScheduleDelivery — those involve a TARGET PERSON to fetch or message.
