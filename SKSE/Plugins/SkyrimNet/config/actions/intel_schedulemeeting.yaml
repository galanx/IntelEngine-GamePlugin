name: ScheduleMeeting
description: >
  Schedule a meeting at a PLACE for a FUTURE TIME. You stay put now and go when the time comes.

  Use whenever the conversation contains ANY hint of a future meeting:
  - Explicit: "meet me at the inn tomorrow", "let's meet at sunset"
  - Agreements: "sure, tomorrow evening", "alright, I'll be there"
  - Farewells: "see you tomorrow", "until tonight", "tomorrow then"
  - Self-initiated: you want to see someone again, or go somewhere later

  If no place is named, infer from context (e.g., current location or last mentioned place).
  Check "Scheduled Commitment" first — don't duplicate an existing meeting.

  NOT GoToLocation (that's RIGHT NOW). NOT ScheduleDelivery/ScheduleFetch (those target a PERSON).

  Time descriptions: dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, sunset, night, midnight,
  tonight, tomorrow, "in 2 hours", "in half an hour", soon, 3pm, etc.

      Where to go. Examples:
      - "Bannered Mare"
      - "Dragonsreach"
      - "the marketplace"
      - "home" or "my home" — YOUR own home (the NPC's home)
      - "<Name>'s home" or "<Name>'s place" — someone's home (e.g., "Alvor's home", "Camilla's place")
      - Just an NPC name like "Camilla" or "Camilla Valerius" — resolves to their home
      - "the temple"
      HOME RULES: "my home" = YOUR home. For the player's home, ALWAYS use
      their name (e.g., if the player is named Erik, write "Erik's home").
      For any NPC's home, use their name (e.g., "Alvor's home", "Camilla's place").

      When to arrive. IMPORTANT: If a relative time is mentioned
      (e.g., "in 2 hours", "in 3 hours"), pass those words EXACTLY as-is.
      Do NOT convert relative times to absolute times like "dawn" or "morning".

      Relative times (pass verbatim):
      - "in 2 hours"
      - "in 1 hour"
      - "in 3 hours"
      - "in half an hour"
      - "soon"

      Absolute times (when a specific time of day is named):
      - "at dawn"
      - "at noon"
      - "in the evening"
      - "after sunset"
      - "tonight"
      - "tomorrow morning"
