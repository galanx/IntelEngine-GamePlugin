description: >
  Schedule to travel to a LOCATION at a FUTURE TIME. Delayed version of GoToLocation — you stay put now and go later.

  BEFORE scheduling: Check your "Scheduled Commitment" section in your bio. If you already have a meeting
  scheduled with this person, do NOT schedule another one unless the time or location needs to change.
  Only reschedule if the conversation explicitly changes the meeting details.

  Use when:
  - You tell someone "meet me at the Bannered Mare at sundown"
  - You agree to meet someone somewhere later (player or another NPC)
  - You decide on your own to go somewhere at a future time (e.g., returning home at dusk)
  - You propose meeting up with someone: "I'll be at Dragonsreach tonight"
  - You and another NPC agree to meet somewhere later
  - You want to keep an appointment or attend a gathering

  This schedules future travel — you will NOT leave immediately.
  You will go to the destination when the time comes.

  IMPORTANT: Use natural time descriptions. The system understands:
  - Times of day: dawn, sunrise, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, sunset, dusk, night, midnight
  - Relative times: tonight, tomorrow, soon, shortly
  - Relative hours: "in 2 hours", "in 1 hour", "a few hours", "in half an hour"
  - Clock times: 3pm, 6am, etc.

      When to arrive. IMPORTANT: If a relative time is mentioned
      (e.g., "in 2 hours", "in 3 hours"), pass those words EXACTLY as-is.
      Do NOT convert relative times to absolute times like "dawn" or "morning".

      Relative times (pass verbatim):
      - "in 2 hours"
      - "in 1 hour"
      - "in 3 hours"
      - "in half an hour"
      - "soon"

      Absolute times (when a specific time of day is named):
      - "at dawn"
      - "at noon"
      - "in the evening"
      - "after sunset"
      - "tonight"
      - "tomorrow morning"
