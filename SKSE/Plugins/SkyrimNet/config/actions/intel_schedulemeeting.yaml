description: >
  Schedule going to a PLACE at a FUTURE TIME. Delayed GoToLocation — you stay put now, go later.

  BEFORE scheduling: Check your "Scheduled Commitment" section. If you already have a meeting
  with this person, do NOT schedule another unless the time or location changed.

  Use when:
  - "meet me at the Bannered Mare at sundown" → you'll go there later
  - You agree to meet someone somewhere at a future time
  - You decide to go somewhere later on your own (returning home at dusk)

  NOT GoToLocation (that's for going RIGHT NOW).
  NOT ScheduleDelivery/ScheduleFetch (those involve going to a PERSON, not a place).

  You will NOT leave immediately. You go when the time comes.

  IMPORTANT: Use natural time descriptions. The system understands:
  - Times of day: dawn, sunrise, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, sunset, dusk, night, midnight
  - Relative times: tonight, tomorrow, soon, shortly
  - Relative hours: "in 2 hours", "in 1 hour", "a few hours", "in half an hour"
  - Clock times: 3pm, 6am, etc.

      When to arrive. IMPORTANT: If a relative time is mentioned
      (e.g., "in 2 hours", "in 3 hours"), pass those words EXACTLY as-is.
      Do NOT convert relative times to absolute times like "dawn" or "morning".

      Relative times (pass verbatim):
      - "in 2 hours"
      - "in 1 hour"
      - "in 3 hours"
      - "in half an hour"
      - "soon"

      Absolute times (when a specific time of day is named):
      - "at dawn"
      - "at noon"
      - "in the evening"
      - "after sunset"
      - "tonight"
      - "tomorrow morning"
