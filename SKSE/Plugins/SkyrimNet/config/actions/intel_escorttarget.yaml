name: EscortTarget
description: >
  Walk WITH someone to a destination. You personally accompany them.

  TRIGGER: Any request to escort, walk, or take someone to a specific place.

  Examples:
  - "take Alvor home", "walk Ysolda to the inn", "escort this pilgrim to Whiterun"
  - "take him home", "walk her to safety"
  - You stay with them during the entire journey

  DECISION RULES:
  - "take X home" or "walk X to Y" = EscortTarget (you walk WITH them)
  - "bring X here" or "get X" = FetchPerson (you go alone, return with them)
  - "tell X to come" = DeliverMessage (relay words, not physically escort)
