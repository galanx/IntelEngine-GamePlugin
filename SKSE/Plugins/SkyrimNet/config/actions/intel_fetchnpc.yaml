name: FetchPerson
description: >
  Physically GO GET someone and WALK THEM BACK. You escort them in person.

  Use when:
  - "fetch Alvor", "go get Ysolda", "bring Nazeem here"
  - You need someone's physical presence and will personally escort them
  - No message involved — just "go get that person and bring them to me"

  NOT DeliverMessage. If someone says "tell X to come here" or "let X know" —
  that means relay a message, use DeliverMessage instead.
  FetchPerson = you walk there, walk back WITH the person. No words to relay.

  The target must be a person who actually exists.

      REQUIRED. Should the target refuse to come?
      If the target would come willingly (most cases), set this to
      the exact string "none" (not empty, not omitted — the word none).
      If the target would realistically refuse, write the reason instead.
      Examples of refusal: "too busy with court duties", "doesn't trust you",
      "refuses to leave the shop unattended"
      Consider the target's personality, social status, and relationship.
