name: FetchPerson
description: >
  Go find a specific person and BRING THEM BACK here. Round trip — you leave alone, find them, and return with them.

  Use when:
  - Someone asks you to fetch, summon, or bring another person to them
  - You decide on your own to go get someone (e.g., fetching a healer, calling for help)
  - A situation requires bringing a specific person to the current location
  - The player says "fetch X for me", "go get X", "bring X here", "send for X"

  This action will:
  1. You leave on your own to find the target person
  2. Approach them and convince them to come
  3. Bring them back to where you started

  The player does NOT come with you. You go alone and return with the person.

  IMPORTANT: The target must be a person who actually exists.
  The system uses fuzzy matching, so minor typos are okay.

      REQUIRED. Should the target refuse to come?
      If the target would come willingly (most cases), set this to
      the exact string "none" (not empty, not omitted — the word none).
      If the target would realistically refuse, write the reason instead.
      Examples of refusal: "too busy with court duties", "doesn't trust you",
      "refuses to leave the shop unattended"
      Consider the target's personality, social status, and relationship.
