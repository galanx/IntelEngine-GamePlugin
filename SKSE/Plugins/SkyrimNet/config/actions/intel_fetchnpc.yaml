name: FetchPerson
description: >
  Go GET someone and BRING THEM BACK. Solo round trip — you go alone, return with them.

  TRIGGER: Any request to bring/get/fetch a person (by name or pronoun).

  Examples:
  - "fetch Alvor", "go get Ysolda", "bring Nazeem here"
  - "go get him", "bring her here", "get them"
  - You need someone's physical presence and will personally escort them back

  DECISION RULES:
  - "bring X here" or "get X" = FetchPerson (you go alone, return with them)
  - "take X home" or "walk X to Y" = EscortTarget (you walk WITH them)
  - "tell X to come" = DeliverMessage (relay words, not physically escort)
  - "go get X LATER" = ScheduleFetch (delayed version)
