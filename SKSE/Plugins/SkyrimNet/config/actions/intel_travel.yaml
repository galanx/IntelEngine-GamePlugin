name: GoToLocation
description: >
  Go to a PLACE right now. Named locations, relative directions (upstairs, outside), or "leave".

  Use when:
  - "go to the Bannered Mare", "head to Whiterun", "go upstairs", "leave"
  - You decide to go somewhere on your own (errands, returning home)
  - You agree to meet someone at a place RIGHT NOW

  NOT ScheduleMeeting (that's for going somewhere LATER).
  NOT FetchPerson/DeliverMessage (those are about a PERSON, not a place).
  Do NOT use just because a location was mentioned in conversation.
