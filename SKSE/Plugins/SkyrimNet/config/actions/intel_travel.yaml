name: GoToLocation
description: >
  Travel to a LOCATION (a place, not a person). Supports named locations (Whiterun, Bannered Mare),
  relative directions (upstairs, outside, downstairs, the bedroom, the back room),
  and semantic terms (leave, get out of here).

  Use when:
  - Someone asks you to go somewhere (a place name, not a person's name)
  - You decide to go somewhere on your own (errands, duties, returning home)
  - You need to leave for personal reasons (emotions, danger, obligations)
  - You want to move to a different part of the building (upstairs, outside, the back)
  - You agree to meet someone at a specific place RIGHT NOW

  DO NOT use just because a location was mentioned in conversation.
  To change speed on an active task, use ChangeSpeed instead.
