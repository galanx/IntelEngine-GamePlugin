name: GoToLocation
description: >
  Go to a PLACE right now. Leave immediately.

  TRIGGER: You need to physically move to a location NOW (not later).

  Examples:
  - "go to the Bannered Mare", "head to Whiterun", "go home"
  - "go upstairs", "go outside", "leave", "go to the back room"
  - You decide to go somewhere on your own right now

  DECISION RULES:
  - Destination is a PLACE (building, city, direction) = GoToLocation
  - Destination is a PERSON (name or pronoun) = NEVER GoToLocation
  - "go get him/her/them" or "bring someone" = FetchPerson, NOT this
  - "go talk to X" or "tell X something" = DeliverMessage, NOT this
  - "take X home" or "walk X to Y" = EscortTarget, NOT this (escorting a person)
  - "go there LATER" or "meet me TONIGHT" = ScheduleMeeting, NOT this
  - Just mentioning a location in conversation does NOT mean go there
