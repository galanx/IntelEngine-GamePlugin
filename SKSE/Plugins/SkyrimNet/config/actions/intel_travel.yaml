name: GoToLocation
description: >
  Go to a PLACE right now. Named locations, relative directions (upstairs, outside), or "leave".

  IMPORTANT: The destination MUST be a PLACE, NEVER a person.
  If asked to "get him", "bring her", "fetch Nazeem", "go get someone" — that's FetchPerson, NOT this.
  ANY request involving a person (name or pronoun like him/her/them) is NEVER GoToLocation.

  Use when:
  - "go to the Bannered Mare", "head to Whiterun", "go upstairs", "leave"
  - You decide to go somewhere on your own (errands, returning home)
  - You agree to meet someone at a place RIGHT NOW

  NOT ScheduleMeeting (that's for going somewhere LATER).
  NOT FetchPerson/DeliverMessage (those are about a PERSON, not a place).
  Do NOT use just because a location was mentioned in conversation.

    name: destination
    description: >
      Where to travel. Can be:
      - A named location: Whiterun, Solitude, Bannered Mare, Dragonsreach
      - A relative term: upstairs, downstairs, outside, inside, the back room
      - "home" or "my home" — YOUR own home (the NPC's home)
      - "<Name>'s home" or "<Name>'s place" — someone's home (e.g., "Alvor's home", "Camilla's place")
      - Just an NPC name like "Camilla" or "Camilla Valerius" — resolves to their home
      - A fuzzy match: "the inn" might match "Bannered Mare"
      The system resolves destinations automatically.
      HOME RULES: "my home" = YOUR home. For the player's home, ALWAYS use
      their name (e.g., if the player is named Erik, write "Erik's home").
      For any NPC's home, use their name (e.g., "Alvor's home", "Camilla's place").
