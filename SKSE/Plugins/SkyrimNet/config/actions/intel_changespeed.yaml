name: ChangeSpeed
description: >
  Change your travel speed mid-task WITHOUT canceling it. Adjusts pace on your current active task.

  Use when:
  - Someone tells you to hurry up, run, go faster, rush, "start running", "pick up the pace"
  - Someone tells you to slow down, walk, take it easy, no rush, "stop running"
  - The urgency of your task changes (e.g. danger ahead, relaxed situation)
  - ANY mention of running, jogging, walking, or pace while you have an active task

  Only works if your "Current Task" shows an active task.
  Do NOT use if you have no current task.

  NOTE: This changes speed only. To completely stop a task, use CancelCurrentTask instead.
