name: ChangeSpeed
description: >
  Change your travel speed mid-task WITHOUT canceling it. Only use this if you are CURRENTLY performing a task (fetching someone, delivering a message, traveling somewhere, etc.).

  Use when:
  - You have an active task AND someone tells you to hurry up, run, go faster, rush, "start running", "pick up the pace"
  - You have an active task AND someone tells you to slow down, walk, take it easy, no rush, "stop running"
  - You have an active task AND the urgency changes (e.g. danger ahead, relaxed situation)

  Do NOT use this if you are idle, sandboxing, or have no current task. This changes speed only. To completely stop a task, use CancelCurrentTask instead.
